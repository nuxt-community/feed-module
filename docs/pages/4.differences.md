There are only two major differences between the versions:

- As you've probably noticed, this module accepts an object with a single property called `sources`, containing feed configuration objects' array or a factory function 
- Each source object is required to be specified with a `meta` object, including `id`, `title`, `link`, `description` and `copyright` properties
