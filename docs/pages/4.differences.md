(By _original module_, I mean [@nuxt-community/feed-module](https://github.com/nuxt-community/feed-module))

Apart from bringing Nuxt 3 support to the table, another goal of this project was adapting as similar of an API as possible. There are only two major differences between the modules:

- As you've probably noticed, this module accepts an object with a single property called `sources`, containing feed configuration objects
- Each source object is required to be specified with a `meta` object, including `id`, `title`, `link`, `description` and `copyright` properties (they're all required)
