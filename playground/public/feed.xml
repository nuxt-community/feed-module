            <content:encoded><![CDATA[US researchers found gas stoves contributing more to global warming as previously thought due to tiny methane leaks. The scientists said that gas stoves in US are putting 6.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide into air when they are running. Surprisingly, the scientists also found methane emissions to the tune of 2.6 million tonnes even when the stoves were off. ]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[NASA's Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Storms (IMPACTS) mission deployed planes equipped with scientific instruments to study US snowstorms. Launched in January, the mission tracks storms by flying two planes at about 65,000 feet, one above the storm and one within clouds. NASA said this will help study snow particles and their precipitation patterns.]]></content:encoded>
